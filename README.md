**Neural Connectivity Analysis through Data Clustering and Statistical Modeling**

**Project Description**
Leveraging data clustering and statistical modeling, this project analyzes reaction times in response to audio, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to uncover patterns in neural activity and connectivity. The aim is to assess the impact of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) on enhancing the understanding of neural processes and potential therapeutic applications.

**Scripts and Analysis**
analysis.py: A Python script for data preprocessing, statistical analysis using ANOVA, and data visualization, highlighting the preprocessing steps and clustering techniques applied.
final.m: A MATLAB script focused on advanced statistical analysis, including outlier detection and reaction time evaluation under various conditions.
**Key Insights**
Our analyses highlight significant findings regarding reaction times influenced by stimulus condition, stimulation group, and time (pre vs. post TNS).
The project underscores the potential of TNS in modulating neural connectivity and optimizing sensory integration, with implications for neurological research and therapy.
**Referential Credits**
The methodologies and analytical approach in this project draw upon the findings and theories presented in the paper "Examining the Effects of Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation on Reaction Times in a Multisensory Integration Task" by Tyler Billingsly, Sean Stanek, & Dr. Christopher Buneo. Their work provided valuable insights into multisensory integration and the effects of TNS, serving as a foundational reference for this study.
